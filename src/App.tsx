              James is a college graduate from Boston. Before graduation, he applied to many companies to get an internship. He has applied to hundred different companies, but only about five companies replied to his resume. He visited one of the companies for an interview and fell in love with the place. It had a clean and tall building, in which so many talented people were collaborating with each other. Luckily, he passed an interview and received an offer letter. He was so excited, but as soon as he graduated, a pandemic happened. Every office had to make a conversion to a remote working environment, and most of the internship had to be cancelled because James had to return to his hometown. He was so frustrated, but he started submitting his resume to companies near his home. One of the companies responded, and he started working at the company. It was not the dream job he imagined, but it turned out he could work with a fair amount of income, and he could save more money by living near his home.

              Kevin was a boy who was a big fan of robotics. He spent most of his time building strange robots in a garage, and for many of his science fair projects were the robots he built. His college essay, of course, was filled with stories of his passion about robotics and engineering. When he went to college, he took several courses related to engineering, and a large number of those courses were about mathematics. One day, he was in the advanced calculs class, and suddenly, he could come up with a brand new idea of solving a very old problem of finding a fastest way from one point to another. He wrote down the solutions, tested it out using his computer, and showed it to his professor. The math professor and Kevin decided to bring it to undergraduate research fair. Inspired by this experience, Kevin decided to change his major to mathematics, and now he's studying mathematics in a graduate school.

              Ellen would identify himself as a very risk averse person. He has never done any investment whatsoever, and he thought that the best way to achieve wealth is by saving. He did not spend money on unnecessary purchases and only spent money when he went to the grocery once a month. One day, one of his friends called him that she was starting a new business and asked Ellen if he could buy some of the stock in a form of investment. He first rejected as he did not like the idea of spending money on something with an uncertain future, but the freind was quite relentless. Finally, Ellen decided to buy 5000 dollars worth of stock, and after than, he completely forgot about the money since he did not belive in fortune. After several years, the freind called him again asking what he has done with the stock, and Ellen answered that he was holding all of the stock he had bought. The friend was surprised and told him that it is at least 100 times more worth than the time he purchased it as the friend's company is getting bigger and bigger.
